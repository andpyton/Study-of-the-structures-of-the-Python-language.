# Programming Logic and Python Structures

This repository is dedicated to the study of programming logic and the core structures of the Python language.

The problems were generated using artificial intelligence and were intentionally solved **without** any AI assistance. Each exercise addresses real-world, modern challenges in the technology field and is designed to reinforce essential concepts associated with the Python structures being studied.

## Topics Covered
- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries
- Functions
- Basic problem-solving strategies

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to strengthen logical thinking and practical Python skills through hands-on problem solving.
